These notes have been collected through various hobby projects. My days as a professional developer are long gone, but I
like to take a hands-on approach to understanding technology, so my projects often don't get past the 'tutorial' stage - just 
enough for me to get the gist of the tech. Put another way, just enough to be dangerous.
